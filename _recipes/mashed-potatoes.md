recipeYield: 6 servings

ingredients:
- 2 pounds peeled Russet potatoes, quartered
- 3 cups water
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt
- 1/2  cup low-fat 1% buttermilk
- 1/4 cup light sour cream (I prefer Breakstone’s)
- 2 tbsp whipped butter
- 1 tsp kosher salt
- fresh black pepper, to taste
- chopped chives or parsley, for garnish

directions:
- Add potatoes to the instant pot and pour enough water to just cover, season with salt.
- Cover and cook on high pressure 10 minutes, quick release to check the potatoes are soft. They are done when a sharp knife can easily be inserted through the potato.
- Drain and reserve 1/2  cup of the water, add the butter, sour cream and buttermilk, salt and black pepper and mash with a potato masher.
- Adjust salt to taste and keep on warm until ready to serve. It’s best to eat right away, but if you’re eating them later and the potatoes get dry, add the reserved water to loosen them.
- Serve garnished with chopped chives or parsley.
