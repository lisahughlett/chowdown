recipeYield: 8 bowls

ingredients:
- 6 tbsp butter unsalted
- 1 onion chopped
- 6 tbsp all-purpose flour
- 2 cups half and half cream
- 6 cups chicken broth low sodium
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp white pepper
- 1/4 tsp nutmeg
- 1 head broccoli florets about 1 lb
- 1 cup Velveeta cubed
- 3 cups cheddar cheese shredded
- 2 tbsp parsley chopped

directions:
- Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened and starts to lightly brown. 
- Sprinkle the flour over the onion and gently whisk it with the butter and onion. Cook it for about 2 minutes to remove that raw starchy flavor. 
- Slowly whisk in the half and half. Once completely mixed in, pour in the chicken broth and whisk to remove lumps and to scrape away the browned bits from the bottom of the pan, if any.
- Season with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Bring the mixture to a boil then add the broccoli pieces. Cook until the broccoli is tender; about 10 minutes.
- Add the Velveeta and 2 cups of the cheddar cheese, stirring constantly until the cheeses have completely melted. Taste for seasoning and adjust as necessary.
- Top with remaining cheddar cheese and garnish with parsley.

From [Jo Cooks](https://www.jocooks.com/recipes/broccoli-cheese-soup/). Doesn't freeze great...

If you don't want to use Velveeta you can substitute it with more cheddar cheese or Monterey Jack cheese, it's just that Velveeta will make the soup more creamier and smooth.
