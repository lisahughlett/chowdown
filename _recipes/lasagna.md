ingredients:
- 2 lbs mild Italian Sausage
- 1 lb ground turkey
- 2 large Onion chopped
- 4 tsp minced garlic
- 2 small tomato paste
- 3 cans tomato sauce
- 4 cups stewed tomatoes (I use diced tomatoes)
- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 1 Tbs dried Basil
- 2 tsp Italian seasoning
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
- 1/4 cup fresh chopped parsley
- 1/2 cup water
- Cheese Mixture
- 32 oz ricotta cheese
- 4 oz cream cheese (optional)
- 2 large eggs
- 1/4 cup fresh chopped parsley
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/8 tsp nutmeg
- 24 lasagna noodles
- 8 cups, about 2 lbs shredded mozzarella cheese
- 1 1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese

directions:
- In a stock pot, cook sausage, ground turkey, onion, and garlic over medium heat. Stir in remaining ingredients listed under meat sauce. Simmer covered for 1-2 hours, stirring occasionally. If you are making this the day before you plan to serve you can skip the long simmer time. The flavors will meld together as it sits in the fridge, even if you have already assembled the lasagna.
- Soak lasagna noodles (24) in hot water for 20 minutes (They will be partially cooked, soft but firm enough that they don't get soggy while baking).
- Combine ingredients for the cheese mixture and set aside.
- Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Set out two 9x13 inch pans.
- To assemble, scoop 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of each 9x13 inch pan. Lay down 6 noodles lengthwise over sauce and spread 1/4 of total cheese mixture in each pan. (This will use half of the cheese mixture.) Next sprinkle 1 1/2 cups mozzarella and 1/4 cup Parmesan on top, per pan. (Or desired amount of cheese) Repeat layers and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil and bake for 1-1.5 hours. The time will vary depending on if you bake both at once. For last 15 minutes, remove foil and allow cheese to crisp up on top. Let lasagna cool or 10 minutes before slicing.
- If you wish to freeze one, cover tightly with foil and pop into the freezer without baking. Remove from freezer the night before you wish to serve it and let it thaw in fridge. Bake covered in foil for approximately 1-1.5 hours. If it is slightly frozen it will take longer of course.
