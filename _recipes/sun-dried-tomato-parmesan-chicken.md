recipeYield: 4 servings

ingredients:
- -- For The Chicken --
- 2 large boneless and skinless chicken breasts, halved horizontally to make 4 fillets
- 2 tablespoons Tapioca flour (or all purpose or plain flour)
- 2 tablespoons finely grated fresh Parmesan cheese (do not include for dairy free option)
- 1 teaspoon salt
- Cracked pepper
- -- For The Sauce --
- 2 tablespoons reserved sun dried tomato oil (or olive oil)
- 2 tablespoons minced garlic
- 7 oz jarred sun dried tomato strips in oil, drained (reserve 2 tablespoons of oil for cooking)
- 1 cup sliced mushrooms
- 1 1/2 cups evaporated milk (reduced fat or full fat milk)
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch (cornflour) mixed with 2 tablespoons of milk
- 1/2 cup fresh grated Parmesan cheese (do not include for dairy free option)
- 2 teaspoons Italian herbs (optional for added flavor)
- 2 tablespoons fresh shredded basil, to serve

directions:
- In a shallow bowl, combine the flour, Parmesan cheese, salt and pepper. Dredge in the flour mixture; shake off excess and set aside.
- Heat 1 tablespoon of the reserved oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Fry the chicken until golden on each side, cooked through and no longer pink (about 5-6 minutes each side, depending on the thickness of your chicken). Transfer onto a warm plate.
- Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil to the skillet; saut√© the garlic until fragrant (about 1 minute). Add the sun dried tomatoes and mushrooms; fry until the mushrooms are just soft.
- Reduce heat to low heat, add the milk (or cream if using) and bring to a gentle simmer, stirring occasionally. Season with salt and pepper to your taste and add the milk/cornstarch mixture to the center of the pan. Continue to simmer while quickly stirring the mixture through until the sauce thickens. (Only use cornstarch if using milk for your sauce.)
- Add in the Parmesan cheese; allow sauce to simmer for a further minute until cheese melts through the sauce. Add the chicken back into the pan; sprinkle with the fresh basil and a little extra pepper (optional), and serve over pasta, rice or steamed veg.
