recipeYield: 4 servings

ingredients:
- 3 tablespoons butter, divided
- 2 eggs, whisked
- 2 medium carrots, peeled and diced
- 1/2 cup frozen peas
- 1 small white onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- salt and pepper
- 4 cups rice, cooked and chilled
- 3 green onions, thinly sliced
- 3-4 tbsp soy sauce, or more to taste
- 2 tbsp oyster sauce (optional)
- 1/2 tsp toasted sesame oil

directions:
- Heat 1/2 tbsp of butter in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat until melted. Add egg, and cook until scrambled, stirring occasionally. Remove egg, and transfer to a separate plate.

- Serve immediately, or refrigerate in a sealed container for up to 3 days.

From [Gimme Some Oven](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/fried-rice-recipe/). You've gotta plan ahead and use thoroughly-chilled cooked rice. A fresh batch of warm rice will not fry well. Leftover refrigerated rice is ideal or just cook a fresh batch of rice. Then spread it out on a baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, then pop it in the fridge for 30 minutes (or in the freezer for 10-15 minutes) until it is thoroughly chilled (not frozen).
