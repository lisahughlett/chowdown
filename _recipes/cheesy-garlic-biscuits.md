recipeYield:

ingredients:
- 1/2 cup butter, divided
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tbsp. granulated sugar
- 1 tbsp. baking powder
- 1 tbsp. garlic powder
- 2 tsp. kosher salt, divided
- 1 cup whole milk
- 2 cups mild cheddar cheese
- 1/2 teaspoon dried parsley

directions:
- Preheat oven to 425 Â°F.
- Prepare a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
- In a medium microwave-safe bowl, add 1/4 cup butter. Heat until butter is melted. (About 25 seconds) Set aside to slightly cool.
- In a large mixing bowl add the flour, sugar, baking powder, garlic and 1 teaspoon salt. Mix until well combined.
- Warm the milk for about 25 seconds in the microwave and combine with the melted butter you set aside and stir well.
- Pour the milk and butter mixture over the dry ingredients and stir until just combined, making sure to not over mix. Add shredded cheese and fold in until cheese is evenly distributed.
- Grab about 1/2 cup of dough with your fingers and drop onto baking sheet. (about the size of a small fist) You can fit 8 large biscuits onto one baking sheet. If you want smaller biscuits, prepare another lined baking sheet and make each biscuit about 1/4 cup.
- Bake for 10-12 minutes, until biscuits are just barely golden brown.
- While biscuits are baking, melt remaining 1/4 cup of butter in small mixing bowl. Microwave for 25 seconds or until butter is melted. Add parsley and stir.
- When biscuits are removed from the oven, immediately brush with butter parsley mixture and sprinkle with kosher salt.
- Serve hot.
