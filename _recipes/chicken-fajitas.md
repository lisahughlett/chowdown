recipeYield: 4 servings

ingredients:
- 1 lb chicken breast, boneless, skinless
- 1 large onion (or 2 smaller ones)
- 1 red bell pepper
- 1 green bell pepper
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 2 1/2 tbsp fajita seasoning
- 1 jalape√±o optional
- 8 medium tortillas
- salsa optional
- sour cream optional

directions:
- Cut the chicken breasts into long strips. Slice the onion into long strips. Slice the peppers into long 1/4 inch strips.
- Heat the olive oil in a large skillet. Add the chicken to the skillet then sprinkle about half of the fajita seasoning over the chicken and toss. Cook the chicken for 5 to 10 minutes until it's fully cooked and no longer pink, and it's slightly charred, but not burned. Transfer the chicken to a plate and set aside.
- Add another tbsp of olive oil to the skillet, if needed. Add the onion and cook for a couple minutes until it's slightly translucent. Add the peppers and the remaining fajita seasoning and toss. Cook for another 3 to 5 more minutes so the peppers cook slightly, you don't want them over cooked, they should be a bit crunchy. Add the chicken back to the skillet and toss with the peppers.
- Serve over tortillas and top with salsa, sour cream and any of your favorite toppings.
