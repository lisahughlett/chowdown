directions:
- Heat 1/2 tbsp of butter in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat until melted. Add egg, and cook until scrambled, stirring occasionally. Remove egg, and transfer to a separate plate.

From [Gimme Some Oven](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/fried-rice-recipe/). You've gotta plan ahead and use thoroughly-chilled cooked rice. A fresh batch of warm rice will not fry well. Leftover refrigerated rice is ideal or just cook a fresh batch of rice. Then spread it out on a baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, then pop it in the fridge for 30 minutes (or in the freezer for 10-15 minutes) until it is thoroughly chilled (not frozen).
