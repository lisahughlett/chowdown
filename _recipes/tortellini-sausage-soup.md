recipeYield: 6

ingredients:
- 3 links Italian sausage
- 4 cloves garlic finely minced
- 1 onion diced
- 4 cups low sodium chicken broth
- 1/2 cup apple cider
- 1 15 oz can diced tomatoes
- 1 8 oz can tomato sauce
- 1 cup chopped carrots
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 2 medium zucchini, grated (may substitute frozen peas)
- 2 Tbsp dried parsley
- 1 tsp dried basil
- 8-10 oz package frozen cheese tortellini

directions:
- Cook sausage in large pot over medium heat. Add the copped onion and garlic. Continue cooking until onions are translucent and the sausage is cooked through. Drain excess grease if needed.
- Stir in the chicken broth, apple cider, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, carrots, oregano, and basil. Bring the soup to a simmer, cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Stir in zucchini and parsley, simmer for 10-12 minutes.
- Add the tortellini and cook until tender, (I usually cook the tortellini for 4-5 minutes so it doesn't fall apart.) Serve immediately with fresh grated Parmesan, if desired.
- Note- If zucchini isn't in season you can substitute chopped spinach or frozen peas. If you can't find apple cider try apple juice.
